# Practicing Functional JavaScript

Why bother?

Functions are __simple__. They are the simplest building blocks we have for making useful software. Simplicity matters because software can be __complex__ and complex software is hard to maintain, hard to test, expensive, and not very fun to work with.

[Simple](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/simple#English): _one fold, the same fold_

[Complex](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/complex#Etymology): _folded together, entwined_

Note: Simple does not mean easy and complex does not mean hard. Hard problems are still hard. Simplicity only makes a hard problem _easier to think about_ by breaking it into simpler, independent parts. Independent parts are _easier to understand_ because you can think about them in isolation before composing them to form a solution.

## Exercises

ðŸ˜Œ Less thinking ðŸ˜° More thinking

- [Hello World](#hello-world)
- [Two Fer](#two-fer)
- [Resistor Color](#resistor-color)
- [Resistor Color Duo](#resistor-color-duo)
- [RNA Transcription](#rna-transcription)
- [Gigasecond](#gigasecond)
- [Space Age](#space-age)

### Hello World

### Two Fer

#### Version 1: Imperative

- Arrow function expression with a block body. ðŸ˜°

```javascript
const twoFer = name => { // block start
  // do this
  // do this
  // ...
} // block end
```

- Imperative `if` statement. ðŸ˜°

```javascript
if (!name) { // block start, does not produce a value
  // do this
  // do this
  // ...
} // block end
```

- Imperative operator `!`.
  - Uses a symbol for logical negation rather than a descriptive of what it does, which is to check if name is one of JavaScript's 7 falsy values. ðŸ˜°

```javascript
if (!name) {

}
```

- Imperative `return` statements. ðŸ˜°

```javascript
const twoFer = name => {
  if (!name) {
    return 'One for you, one for me.'; // do this return
  }

  return `One for ${name}, one for me.`; // or do this return
};
```

- Imperative template literal interpolation. ðŸ˜°

#### Version 2: More Functional - No libraries

- Conditional (ternary) expression.
  - No `if` statement. ðŸ˜Œ
  - Produces a value like the function `(string?, string, string) -> string`. ðŸ˜Œ

- Conditional (ternary) operator
  - No block statement. ðŸ˜Œ
  - No `return` statements. ðŸ˜Œ
  - Uses symbolic syntax `?:` rather than descriptive words that are different from typical functions. ðŸ˜°
- Template literal interpolation. ðŸ˜°

```javascript
const twoFer = name =>
  name ? `One for ${name}, one for me.` : 'One for you, one for me.';
```

#### Version 3: Functional - Ramda

- `ifElse` function.
  - No conditional operator. ðŸ˜Œ
- `isNil` function.
  - No conditional operator. ðŸ˜Œ
- `interpolate` function.
  - No template literal interpolation. ðŸ˜Œ

### Resistor Color

### Resistor Color Duo

### RNA Transcription

### Gigasecond

### Space Age

### What is this?

_Practicing Functional JavaScript_ is a collection of [exercises](#what-is-the-approach) for practicing functional programming with JavaScript. The emphasis is on experience and building patterns through exposure to many examples. Understanding the meaning of words like referential transparency and function composition is more useful when the underlying concepts can be recognized through repeated exposure to the patterns and to specific examples.

The exercises focus on the functional part of functional programming or the techniques that are available when working with pure functions. Functions are the best practical entry point to functional programming and a great way to practice patterns that can easily be used in any code base. This is not intended to cover the equally important, but more advanced topics of structuring data, and managing state and side effects.

### Why does this exist?

Purpose: Create an example-based resource of exercises for practicing functional patterns in JavaScript that bridges the gap between imperative and functional thinking.

There are some great [functional programming books](#resources) that use JavaScript. They give a good overview of functional programming and explain core concepts through thoughtful and engaging discussions with pertinent examples. The focus of Practicing Functional JavaScript is practice. Practice to gain exposure to functional patterns and functional thinking, practice refactoring imperative to functional code, and examples to anchor functional concepts to.

### Who is this for?

Practicing Functional JavaScript is for anyone who wants to practice functional programming patterns and functional thinking in JavaScript by refactoring exercises from imperative to functional solutions.

This is not intended to be used on its own, especially for people who are learning to code. Functional programming is a great introduction to programming and there are great introductory texts, but the approach doesnâ€™t try to teach the concepts, it simply provides a resource of examples for mapping those concepts to.

### What is the approach?

#### Exercism

> Code Practice and Mentorship for Everyone.

[Exercism](https://exercism.io/) is a great platform to practice programming and the
foundation for Practicing Functional JavaScript for three main reasons:

1. 101 open source JavaScript exercises
1. Test-driven
1. Modern JavaScript development environment and tooling

#### ESLint and eslint-plugin-functional

> A pluggable and configurable linter tool for identifying and reporting on
> patterns in JavaScript.

> ESLint rules to disable mutation and promote fp in JavaScript and TypeScript.

Linting is great for learning because it can help you begin to notice patterns
and think about concepts that you may not have been aware of. In a
multi-paradigm language as flexible as JavaScript, linting is
essential for writing understandable and maintainable code. [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is great
because it is configurable and customizable with plugins like
[eslint-plugin-functional](https://github.com/jonaskello/eslint-plugin-functional).
This plugin enforces functional patterns and is also a great source of
practical information about functional programming.

#### Ramda

> A practical functional library for JavaScript programmers.

Ramda is the easiest JavaScript library to start practicing functional
programming patterns with in JavaScript. It has a great philosophy that takes care of abstracting functional
concepts and patterns that you donâ€™t get out of the box with JavaScript. It also
has great documentation and a great community. There is a wealth of information
to learn from and understand functional programming.

#### Hindley Milner Types

> A classical type system for the lambda calculus with parametric polymorphism.

Type systems are not strictly required for functional programming since the Lambda Calculus foundation that Functional Programming is based on can be typed or untyped. Whether strongly typed or dynamic like JavaScript, practice thinking about the type signatures of functions is a useful skill. We will use the most widely understood type annotations: The [Hindley-Milner type system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system). See [Chapter 7: Hindley-Milner and Me](https://drboolean.gitbooks.io/mostly-adequate-guide-old/content/ch7.html) of Professor Frisby's Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming for a fun and accessible introduction.

## Reference

- Action
- Declarative: what to do
- Expression: evaluates to a value
- Imperative: how to do something
- Pure Function: A function which has a return value that is only affected by its input parameters, no side effects. See [Purity](https://github.com/hemanth/functional-programming-jargon#purity) and [Pure Function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function).
- Side effect: Relies on reading or writing to a variable or reference outside of the function. Performs an action outside of the function.
- Statement: performs an action
